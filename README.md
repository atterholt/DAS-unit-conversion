# DAS-unit-conversion
This is a brief tutorial showing how the FK coronae rescaling may be accomplished using an example strain rate wavefield from a local earthquake. 

Inventory of scripts:
UnitConversion.m - Script that takes a strain or strain rate wavefield (in this example, EQ_strainrate.mat) and converts it to velocity or acceleration. 
MedianFilter.m - Script that performs median filtering as a preprocessing step.

Inventory of items:
EQ_strainrate.mat - MAT file of a DAS recording of an earthquake in strain rate used in the example script.
